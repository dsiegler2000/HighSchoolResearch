## High School Research

This repo contains most of the research work I did in high school (it does not include the work I did at Cleveland State for two summers, as I can't release that currently). There are three main research projects I worked on in high school.

### Case Research Project
During the summer of 2016, I worked at Case Western Reserve University in a radiation oncology lab. I worked on plasmid cloning while there. More about my work can be found in the `cwru` folder.

### Sentiment Analysis
From the fall of 2016 to the fall of 2017 I worked on a project that compared different learning algorithms on the task of sentiment analysis for movie reviews. Notably, I compared the DCNN model in the task. The original paper claimed that the Dynamic CNN model was highly versatile and adaptable for other tasks, which my work seemed to confirm. The work I presented can be found in the `sentiment_analysis` folder and the code for this project and some more information can be found [here](https://github.com/dsiegler19/dcnn_sentiment_analysis).

### Medical Literature Encoding
From the spring of 2017 to the spring of 2019 I worked on a research project about a novel architecture for extracting information from medical literature. This project was funded by my school's Strnad program. The presentations on this project can be found in the `medical_lit` folder.
